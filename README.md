# hekate_boot_dat

Did this because I still have a SX dongle, I think it should work for SX Gear as well.

Creates a SX boot.dat from the latest Hekate release using GitHub Actions and publishes it as a release. Just extract it, put it at the root of your SD card and boot to Hekate using your SX dongle.

[Latest release](https://github.com/mondul/hekate_boot_dat/releases/latest)
